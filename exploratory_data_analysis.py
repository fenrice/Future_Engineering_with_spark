Checking the version of which Spark and Python installed is important as it changes very quickly and drastically.
Reading the wrong documentation can cause lots of lost time and unnecessary frustration!

This course touches on a lot of concepts you may have forgotten, so if you ever need a quick refresher, 
download the PySpark Cheat Sheet and keep it handy!
